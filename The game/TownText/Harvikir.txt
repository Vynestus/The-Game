Grandfather: you know the stories I told you about yesterday? This is just like then
I need you to do something for me ok? Back then, at one point a man approached me.
He told me that he saw my mother and father before they died. I didn’t believe him.
The man was covered in pock marks and rags, he seemed like an insane old man.
He told me that i was to hold a secret until the time came, that if I didn’t hold the secret,
people who are very dangerous would come looking for me.
This man told me that my parents were taken into a following designated to obtain 7 swords.
 The entire group failed.
We need someone to take this quest. It should be you. I know your training has been going well. 
I believe you can do this. If you can’t do this, next time this happens, it’ll be greater, worse.
END
