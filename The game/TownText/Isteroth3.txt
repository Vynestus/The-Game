*You approach the gates of Isteroth. Large spires can be seen around the town, obviously a magic place*
Town Guard: You there! I have been told to take you in. Come along, follow me!
*Other guards in the towers seem to keep a close eye on you. It would be best if you followed her.
The guard leads you through the town, and leads you into a large building with a rounded purple top
She leads you through the halls of the large building and finally at the end of a hallways, the guard knocks on a door softly
After a moment, the door opens and a woman sits at a desk before you.
Woman: Hello, I'm Selvry. Hopefully I did not scare you with the guards. I simply wished to speak to you before anyone else.
I've been told of what you're trying to do. It's an honorable deed you know, It's hard to see you finishing.
No offence.
I would offer you assistance but there aren't many who are brave enough to take on the quest that you have.
The most we can offer you is the hospitality in this town. I hope you can go far. We put our faith in you.
I think I may say it for the entire town, we thank you for your service.
END
