*You approach the gates of Isteroth. Large spires can be seen around the town, obviously a magic place*
Town Guard: You there! I have been told to take you in. Come along, follow me!
*Other guards in the towers seem to keep a close eye on you. It would be best if you followed her.
The guard leads you through the town, and leads you into a large building with a rounded purple top
She leads you through the halls of the large building and finally at the end of a hallways, the guard knocks on a door softly
After a moment, the door opens and a woman sits at a desk before you.
Woman: Hello, I'm Selvry. Hopefully I did not scare you with the guards. I simply wished to speak to you before anyone else.

END
