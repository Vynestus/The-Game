Mother: I'm so glad you could make it. I wish your father could be here with us.*sigh* He always liked the festival.
The fireworks are about to start, come sit with me. You know they say the fireworks are fueled my magic. 
We could never create anything before then. The people sail out to the mountain in the sea and set them off there.
It's incredible what they're able to do every year. 
You know, I'm so proud of you. It's your eighteenth summer. You grew up so fast. Your father would love to see you now, I'm sure.
*Your mother leans in closer as the the mountain glows a bright green*
Mother: What was that? I didn't see any firework explode.
*The tip of the mountain glows brighter, all the land around you becoming green. 
Your mother stands up and runs
Mother: Come here, Run. Don't look back
*Screams can be heard around the town. The green grows darker, eminating from behind you as you run.*
Your grandfather runs out of your house, looking to your mother in bewilderment.
Grandfather: Carol! Carol!
Mother: Dad what is going on?
*You your mother and your grandfather run, but as your going, something strikes your mothers back.
You turn around and see her on the ground. Your grandfathers hand pulls you along into the cellar of your house.
There's only darkness down here. Any questions you ask your grandfather, he stays silent.
